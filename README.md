Cohort Assignments Repository

This repository is created to maintain and track all tasks and assignments completed during my cohort journey.

All assignments related to the cohort will be added to this repository.
For better organization, assignments are grouped based on the technology used.

📁 Repository Structure

A separate folder is created for each technology (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)

Inside each technology folder, individual assignment folders are created

Each assignment folder contains the files related to that specific task
